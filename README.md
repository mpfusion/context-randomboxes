### MetaPost Random Boxes

This ConTeXt module is based on John Hobby's boxes MetaPost module. Three
extra MetaPost macros are defined, `drawrandomboxed`, `drawrandomarrow` and
`drawdblrandomarrow`. The macros draw the lines multiple times to simulate
hand-drawn lines.

It uses the global MetaPost instance. It is not customizable and contains
several hard-coded values.
